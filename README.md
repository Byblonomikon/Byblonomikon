# Document Organization and Management Software

This project aims to develop a mobile app and computer software that facilitates the organization of digital documentation for users. The primary objective of this software is to classify and digitize documents of interest to the user, which may not necessarily be within the literary or academic spectrum. These documents are considered personal and private, such as certificates, academic titles, employment contracts, rental agreements, and more. As public administration increasingly transitions to digital formats, there is a need to have information under control and prevent loss due to computer or system errors.

The idea behind this project is to analyze existing similar projects in the market and propose improvements, with a particular focus on handling sensitive data, whether personal or academic. To achieve this, distributed ledger technology (DLT) or blockchain will be applied for storing the information. This approach ensures the permanent availability of data from any location while guaranteeing immutability through decentralization of information control.

The project will consist of several phases. Initially, an analysis of the current state of the topic will be conducted, including studying various existing similar projects, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, the functionalities and architecture of the software will be explained, serving as the core of the project. The application's operation will be described, involving different elements that form the blockchain and IPFS ecosystem.

## Features

Document classification and organization
Digitization of personal and private documents
Secure storage using distributed ledger technology
Availability of data from any location
Guaranteed immutability of information
Robust handling of sensitive data


## Installation

To install and run the software, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies and libraries.
Configure the database connection and security settings.
Build and compile the software.
Start the application.


## Usage

Once the software is up and running, users can perform the following actions:

Register an account and log in.
Upload and classify documents.
View and search for stored documents.
Access documents from any location.
Update or delete documents when necessary.


## Architecture

The software architecture follows a client-server model, with the client component available as a mobile app and computer software. The server component incorporates blockchain technology for distributed storage and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized file management. The integration of these elements ensures data security, availability, and immutability.
